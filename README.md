# LUA
An ongoing complete list of solutions, all lua exercises in the official Lua Documentation... Not yet complete tho! :)

  **If you're new to lua;**

1. Android Users: 
  You can use an online lua compiler eg  [Online Lua Compiler](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_lua_online.php) OR Use Termux(recommended).
  You can download termux from [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) or their official [Github Page](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases)
  
2. Linux(Debian) Users:
  All our exercises were done with lua 5.3, you can easily install lua 5.3 or any later version with 
  
        sudo apt install lua5.3
  
  OR follow this [Guide](https://www.tecmint.com/install-lua-in-centos-ubuntu-linux/)
  
 For any other Linux Distro, follow this [Guide](https://www.tecmint.com/install-lua-in-centos-ubuntu-linux/)

3. Windows Users:
   Overall, Installing lua ( > 5.3) on windows, is the most tricky, but if you follow up the tutorials keenly, it won't be a drag! [Lua Windows](https://gist.github.com/Egor-Skriptunoff/cb952f7eaf39b7b1bf739b818ece87cd)
   
4. For MacOS Users:
   
Take Lua 5.3 as example:

Open your Terminal app

      wget http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.4.6.tar.gz
      

      `tar xvzf lua-5.4.6.tar.gz`

      `cd lua-5.4.6/src`

make macosx(I believe you have Xcode installed)

After that, you can see 'lua' binaries under the current dir.

      `sudo mkdir /usr/bin/lua`

      `sudo cp .* /usr/bin/lua`

      `lua -v` --> Lua Version

Now you can run our codes have fun. :)
